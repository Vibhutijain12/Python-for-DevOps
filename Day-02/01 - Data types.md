## Data Types

In Python, data types define the type of data a variable can store.

Understanding data types is very important for automation, scripting, API handling, and infrastructure tasks in DevOps.

Python automatically assigns a data type when a value is stored in a variable.

Data types are essential because they determine how data is stored in memory and what operations can be performed on that data.

#### 1. Numeric Data Types:

* int - An integer stores whole numbers.
* float - A float stores decimal numbers.

#### 2. Sequence Types: 

* str - A string is a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes.
* list - A list is an ordered collection of items.
* tuple - A tuple is like a list, but immutable (cannot be changed).

#### 3. Mapping Types: 

* dict - A dictionary stores data as key-value pairs.

#### 4. Set Types: 

* set - A set stores unique values. 

#### 5. boolean Types: 

* bool - Boolean values are True or False.

#### 6. None Types:

* NoneType - Represents the None object, which is used to indicate the absence of a value or a null value.
